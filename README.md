# ConsoleFlappyBird

Simple game for windows command prompt written in c++ for my first semestral project in my IT studies.

To bypass the restriction of using the limited color palette of the command line
it uses a pixel approach which sadly makes it much slower.

In retrospect, the version with characters as pixels would probably be much more efficient.

---------------

The project was created entirely by me - [\(Łukasz Piątkowski)](https://github.com/LukaszPiatkowski27) in Code::Blocks IDE <br>
and was implemented for the purposes of computer science studies at the Silesian University of Technology
